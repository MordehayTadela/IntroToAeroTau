    "# Vortex panel method\n",
    "Historically, the first panel method ever developed was a source-sheet method. At the time, Douglas Aircraft Company was concerned with calculating the flow around bodies of revolution, and it was only later that the method was extended to lifting surfaces. (See the reference below for a nice historical account.)\n",
    "\n",
    "A *source-panel method* leads to a solution with no circulation, therefore no lift. The objective of this lesson is to start with the source panel method we implemented in the previous lesson and add some *circulation* so that we may have a lift force. We introduce an important concept: the **Kutta-condition** that allows us to determine what the right amount of circulation should be.\n",

    "## A lifting-body panel method\n",
    "If we were to simply increase the angle of attack in the freestream and calculate the flow with a source sheet only, the rear stagnation point will not be located at the trailing edge. Instead, the flow will bend around the trailing edge and the stagnation point will be somewhere on the top surface of the airfoil. This is not a physically possible solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Kutta condition\n",
    "\n",
    "The *Kutta-condition* states that the pressure below and above the airfoil trailing edge must be equal so that the flow does not bend around it and instead leaves the airfoil tangentially. The rear stagnation point must be exactly at the trailing edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's natural to be a little perplexed by this. How can we justify this seemingly arbitrary condition? Remember that potential-flow theory completely ignores fluid viscosity, so if we are leaving out this physical effect, we shouldn't be surprised that the theory needs some adjustment for those situations when viscosity does play a role. A real viscous fluid is not able to turn around a sharp corner like an airfoil trailing edge without separating there. The Kutta condition allows us to correct potential-flow theory so that it gives a solution closer to reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember **lift always requires circulation**. If you experimented with the circulation of the point vortex, you found that the stagnation points moved along the cylinder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like for the circular cylinder, the amount of circulation we add to an airfoil will move the stagnation points along the surface. And if we add just the right amount, the rear stagnation point can be made to coincide with the trailing edge. This amount of circulation makes the flow a physically relevant solution. And this amount gives the correct lift!\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement the Kutta-condition in our panel method we need to add one more equation to the system, giving the circulation that moves the stagnation point to the trailing edge. By placing a vortex-sheet with the same constant strength at every panel, we can add the circulation to the flow with just one more unknown.\n"
