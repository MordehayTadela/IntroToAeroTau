    "# Flow over a cylinder with source-panels\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, the objective is to calculate the source-strength distribution that can produce potential flow around a given geometry: a circular cylinder. We know that we can get the flow around a cylinder by superposing a doublet in a free stream, but here we want to develop a more general approach that can later be extended to *different* shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we are aiming for is a method that starts with a defined body geometry, then works out the strength of sources needed in each panel representing that geometry to get a dividing streamline right on the body boundary. We will have to solve for the source strengths by specifying that the body be a streamline, i.e., the velocity be tangent there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by loading the Python libraries that we will need in this notebook."
